  <h1>HIIIIIIII!!!</h1>
  <p>I have a dog named Lola!! She's so cute! I love her. She's a little chihuahua. I got her when I was about 7.
I also have a brother named Marcos! He's so cool! He's my twin and he does kickboxing! We do kickboxing together! We're twins and poeple are usually so surprised to here that.
<i>I think SMASH is so cool. My classmates are so cool. I think they're so smart! They're so welcoming and kind. So is my roommate. If I have questions she'll answer them and I hope she doesn't mind.</i></p>
